## Professional Self-Assessment

During the course of CS-499, my 2025 Computer Science Capstone class, I have completed coursework and developed an ePortfolio which have helped me showcase my strengths and helped me prepare to enter the field of computer science. The biggest example of this is the final project and the milestones leading up to it, which helped me consolidate the skills I have learned from previous courses and gain experience with showcasing my abilities and experience, but the journal assignments have also refreshed or improved my knowledge on a variety of topics which Iâ€™m sure I will find useful when I enter the computer science field, such as computer science trends, emerging technologies, career choices, and marketing my skills. 

I have decent skills in the computer science categories that the project milestones focused on, especially in the software design and engineering category. However, communication and collaboration are unfortunately not my area of expertise. Collaborating with other software developers is something I have had very little experience with, and receiving feedback on my work from teachers and instructors is the closest experience I have had to communicating with stakeholders. Most of my computer science education has focused on programming skills and general computer science knowledge rather than on working with other people, which means I have gained a solid grounding in software design, software engineering, programming, algorithms and data structures, databases, and security. As a student yet to enter the workforce, I have more theoretical knowledge than practical experience in the latter three categories, but I am able to use them to accomplish computer science related objectives without too much trouble.

## Code Review

The Code Review video I made for CS-499 can be found [here](https://1drv.ms/v/c/8fda3c33647c1117/EYTDJIOwTyxPgKZaJpDjEx4BAbYFAbU8wnaoC2uix0U92w?e=LkrVWf).

## Original Artifacts
For the CS-499 Capstone project, I had to select one to three artifacts representing the following categories.
- Software Design and Engineering
- Algorithms and Data Structures
- Databases

To represent these three categories of Computer Science, I selected three artifacts from the CS-340 and CS-350 final projects.

For the Software Design and Engineering enhancement, I selected the [ProjectTwoDashboard.ipynb](CS-340-Client-Server-Development-Artifact/ProjectTwoDashboard_original.ipynb) file from CS-340.

For the Algorithms and Data Structures enhancement, I selected the [Thermostat.py](CS-350-Emerging-Sys-Arch-and-Tech-Artifact/Thermostat_original.py) file from CS-350.

And for the Databases enhancement, I selected the [AnimalShelterCRUD.py](CS-340-Client-Server-Development-Artifact/AnimalShelterCRUD_original.py) file from CS-340. This is a supporting file for the Project Two Dashboard, so the narratives for the first and third enhancements have been linked.

## Enhancements
### ProjectTwoDashboard.ipynb
For this enhancement, I have changed the layout of the dashboard's user interface to more closely align with UI/UX principles, including simplifying the dashboard view and organizing the information flow to make sure important data is presented to the user before other information.

The enhanced ProjectTwoDashboard.ipynb artifact can be found [here](CS-340-Client-Server-Development-Artifact/ProjectTwoDashboard_enhancement1.ipynb).

### Thermostat.py
For this enhancement, I have implemented code for a machine learning algorithm so that the thermostat controller can use data it has recorded in the past to predict the temperature at some point in the future, or the optimal set point temperature for a particular temperature at the current time.

The enhanced Thermostat.py artifact can be found [here](CS-350-Emerging-Sys-Arch-and-Tech-Artifact/Thermostat_enhancement2.py).

### AnimalShelterCRUD.py
For this enhancement, I have updated the CRUD functionality of this file to allow the program to handle more advanced database operations, such as including multiple data entries at a time during normal CRUD operations, or counting the number of entries in a subset of the database.

The enhanced AnimalShelterCRUD.py artifact can be found [here](CS-340-Client-Server-Development-Artifact/AnimalShelterCRUD_enhancement3.py).
