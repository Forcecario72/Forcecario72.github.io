## Professional Self-Assessment

During the course of CS-499, my 2025 Computer Science Capstone class, I have completed coursework and developed an ePortfolio which have helped me showcase my strengths and helped me prepare to enter the field of computer science. The biggest example of this is the final project and the milestones leading up to it, which helped me consolidate the skills I have learned from previous courses and gain experience with showcasing my abilities and experience, but the journal assignments have also refreshed or improved my knowledge on a variety of topics which Iâ€™m sure I will find useful when I enter the computer science field, such as computer science trends, emerging technologies, career choices, and marketing my skills. 

I have decent skills in the computer science categories that the project milestones focused on, especially in the software design and engineering category. However, communication and collaboration are unfortunately not my area of expertise. Collaborating with other software developers is something I have had very little experience with, and receiving feedback on my work from teachers and instructors is the closest experience I have had to communicating with stakeholders. Most of my computer science education has focused on programming skills and general computer science knowledge rather than on working with other people, which means I have gained a solid grounding in software design, software engineering, programming, algorithms and data structures, databases, and security. As a student yet to enter the workforce, I have more theoretical knowledge than practical experience in the latter three categories, but I am able to use them to accomplish computer science related objectives without too much trouble.
